- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which is a type of deep learning model specifically designed to process and classify images

- This model is a Supervised Learning model because it has been trained on a labeled dataset (MNIST) where each image is associated with a correct label (the digit it represents). The model learns to map input images to their corresponding labels by minimizing the error between its predictions and the actual labels during training.

- **Type of Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  
- **Purpose:** The model is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images, specifically for the MNIST dataset or similar digit datasets.
  
- **Supervised Learning:** The model was trained using labeled data, meaning it learned to predict digits based on examples provided during training.
